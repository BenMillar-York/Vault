A polynomial is an expression composed of terms, which are themselves composed of variables, constants and exponents.
$$5x^2+2x+5$$Is a second order polymomial, the order of a polynomial is defined as the largest exponent of a variable with a non- zero constant.
$$0x^4+2x^3+x^2+5$$
Is a third order polynomial, as the largest non- zero term has a degree of 3.
$$9$$ A constant is also a polynomial, of the order 0.
