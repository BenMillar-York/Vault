An improvement on the [[Rectangular approximation]], for determining the [[Integration|Integral]] of a curve with discrete sampled ponts, where we assume the sampled value is assumed to have changed linearly over the previous sample period.
This is a $\text{1}^{\text{st}}$- order approximation.
$$\left.\int_0^te(\tau)d\tau\right|_{t = nT}\approx\sum_{n=1}^n(\frac{e_k+e_{k-1}}{2}T)$$
The is the same as the rectangular approximation but assuming the height of the rectangle is half- way between the two sample points.
