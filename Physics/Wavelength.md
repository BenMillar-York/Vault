The wavelength is the spatial period of a periodic wave, it is the distance over which the wave's shape repeats. It is denoted by the symbol $\lambda$.

$$\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$$
Where:
- v is the [[Phase Velocity]]
- f is the [[Frequency]]

## In vacuum
A wave's wavelength depends on the medium it is travelling through, if the wavelength is travlelling in a vacuum or free space the symbol $\lambda_0$ can be used to denote it's wavelength in a vacuum.
$$\lambda_0=\frac{c}{f}$$
## Refratice Index
The [[refractive index]] of the material the wave is travelling through can be given by the following equation relating the wavelength in material to the wavelength in vacuum.
$$\frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda}=n$$
