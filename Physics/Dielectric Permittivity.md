Dialectric Permitity, denoted by the symbol epsilon $\epsilon$ is a mesasure of a substances ability to hold an electrical charge.

It is mesasured in [[Farad|Farads]] per meter meaning it is independant of the substances length.

The dialectric permitity of a vacumm, denoted by $\epsilon _0$ is defined as
$$\epsilon _0 = 8.85*10^{-12} F/m$$
When the dialectric permitity of an sustance is given it is often given as a relative dialectric permitity as compared with $\epsilon_0$.

For example water has a relative dialectric permitity of $\epsilon_r=80$ so when finding $\epsilon$ for water we would say
$$\epsilon=\epsilon_r\epsilon_0$$
$$\epsilon=80*8.85*10^{-12}F/m$$
