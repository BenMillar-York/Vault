The refreactice inex of an optical medium is a [[Scalar]] quantity that gives an indication of how much light is bend or refracted when entering a material.

It is usually denoted by the symbol $n$ and is related to the [[Dielectric Permittivity]] of a material by the following relationship.

$$n=\sqrt{\epsilon_r}$$
