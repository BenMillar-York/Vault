The frequency of a wave is the number of waves that pass a fixedd point in time.
It is denoted by the symbol f and is given by:
$$f=\frac{v}{\lambda}$$
Where:
- v is the [[Phase Velocity]]
- $\lambda$ is the [[Wavelength]]

It has units Hertz (Hz)

## Frequency groups
Frequencies can be divided into groups and given names explaining their typical applications.
