The phase velocity of an electromagnetic wave is the rate at which a wave propagates in a medium. It is denoted by the symbol $v$ and is defined as
$$v=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}}$$

Where:
- $\epsilon$ is the [[Dielectric Permittivity]] of the material
- $\mu$ is the [[Vacuum Permeability]] of the material
