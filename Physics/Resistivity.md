Resistivity is a fundamental property of a material that measures how strongly it resists electric current. It's inverse is [[Conductivity]].

It is measured in $\frac{\ohm}{m}$ and is therefore independant of the length of the material.

It is similar to resistance, however is usually used when describing a material rather than the resistance to an electric current.
