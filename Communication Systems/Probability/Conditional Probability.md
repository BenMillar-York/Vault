The probability of an event $Y$ occuring given that an event $X$ is known to have occurred is given by rearranging the last expression
$$P(Y|X) = \frac{P(X\text{ and } Y)}{P(X)}=\frac{P(Y).P(X|Y)}{P(X)}$$
This relationship between the conditional probabilities $P(Y|X)$ amd $P(X|Y)$ is known as [[Bayes' Rule]].
