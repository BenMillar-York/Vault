A permutation is an ordered selection from a group of objects

The permutation of three objects A, B, C are:
- ABC
- ACB
- BAC
- BCA
- CAB
- CBA

Unlike [[Combination|combinations]] The position of each object is important.

## Permutation formula
Assume you have 10 objects and which to arrange 3, there will be 720 different permutations of objects
$$\text{Number of permutations, P} = 10*9*8 = \frac{10!}{(10-3)!}=720$$
$$^nP_r=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$
Where:
- $n$ is the number of different objects
- $r$ is the number of objects to be arranged
