Joint probability is the likelihood of two [[Event|events]] occuring together at the same point in time.

The probability that two [[Independant Events]] $X$ and $Y$ both occur is given by the product of their respective probabilities
$$P(X\text{ and } Y) = P(X,Y) = P(X).P(Y)$$
If the events are not [[Independant Events|indepdant]]
$$P(X\text{ and } Y) = P(X).P(Y|X) = P(Y) .P(X|Y)$$
Where $P(Y|X)$ is the [[Conditional Probability]] that $Y$ will occur given that $X$ is known to have occured.
