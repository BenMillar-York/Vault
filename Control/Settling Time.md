Denoted by $T_s$ the settling time is the time taken for a system to reach within 2% of it's final value.

It can be aproximated by:
$$T_s = \frac{4}{\alpha}$$
For $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ order systems, where $\alpha$ is the real part of the [[Dominance|dominant]] pole location in the left hand s-plane.

For higher order systems the same aproximation can be used to lesser effects. 

Due to [[Dominance]] the slower poles will dominate the systems response.
