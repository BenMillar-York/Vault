The system type is the radix of s that can be factorted out from the denominator [[Polynomial]] of the transfer function. 
It represents the number of pure Integrators in the open- loop system.

If a system has the open- loop transfer function equal to
$$G(s)\triangleq\frac{K_g(1+T_as)(1+T_bs)\text{...}}{s^m(1+T_1s)(1+T_2s)\text{...}}$$
The magnitude of m equls the [[System Type]].
$K_g$ is the gain constant of the system.
