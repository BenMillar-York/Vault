The damping ratio $\zeta$ controls the % overshoot of the system.

You can find a pole matching a desired damping ratio by using the formula.

$$\theta=\cos^{-1}\zeta$$
Where $\theta$ is the angle, from the origin towards the negative s plane, along which you will find the pole corrosponding to the desired damping ratio, if one exists.
