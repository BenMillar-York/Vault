The monic form of a [[Polynomial]] is the form with a leading coefficient of 1.
$$2s^2 + 4s + 8$$ is not in monic form, the monic form of the above [[Polynomial]] would be $$s^2 + 2s +4$$ This means the monic form gain is equal to 2.

## Monic form gain
The monic form gain of a system is the leading coeffients of the numerator and denomincator polynomicals
$$G(s) = \frac{2s^2+5s+6}{4s^3+6s+7}$$
Has a monic form gain of $\frac{1}{2}$
$$G(s) = \frac{3}{2s}$$
Has a monic form gain of $\frac{3}{2}$
