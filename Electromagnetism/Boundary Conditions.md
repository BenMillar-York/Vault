$\epsilon_{r1} < \epsilon_{r2}$
At the interface between two materials, 1 and 2, the electric and magnetic field densities satiify the boundary conditions below

### Tangential component
Tangential refers to the component being $90^\degree$ away from the normal. The vector n in the above image is normal to the interface. $E_t = E_\text{tangential}$
$$E_{t1} = E_{t2}$$
Where E is the [[Electric Field]]
If one of the materials is an ideal conductor
$$E_{t1} = E_{t2} \approx 0$$
$$H_{t1} = H_{t2}$$
Where H is the [[Magnetic Field]]
Generally:
$$H_{t1} = H_{t2}=J_s$$
## Normal component
Normal refers to being $90^\degree$ from the interface. The vector n in the above image is normal to the interface. $E_n = E_\text{normal}$
$$E_{n2}=\frac{\epsilon_{r1}}{\epsilon_{r2}}E_{n1}$$

$$H_{n2}=\frac{\mu_{r1}}{\mu_{r2}}H_{n1}$$
Since $\mu_r = 1$ in non- ferromagnets
$$H_{n2}=H_{n1}$$

$$D_{n1}=D_{n2}$$
Where D is the [[Electric flux density]]
$$B_{n1}=B_{n2}$$
Where B is the [[Magnetic flux density]]

## A combination
When you have a field moving at an angle not entirely tangential or normal to the interface you can use [[Pythagoras' Theorem]] to find the new combined field magnitude.
$$E=\sqrt{(E_t)^2+(E_n)^2}$$
