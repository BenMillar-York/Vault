The wave impedance of an electromagnetic wave is the ratio of the transverse components of the electric and magnetic fields.

It is usually denoted by the symbol $\eta$ although Z is also sometimes used.

$$\eta=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\epsilon}}$$
Where:
- $\mu$ is the [[Vacuum Permeability|Magnetic Permeability]]
- $\epsilon$ is the [[Dielectric Permittivity]]

As it is the ratio of the the electric and magentic fields
$$\eta=\frac{E_0}{H_0}$$
If the wave impedance is known it can often be used to find the magnitude of the electric or magnetic fields if the other is known. 
E.g.
$$H_0=\frac{E_0}{\eta}$$
# In Free Space
In free space the wave impedance of planes waves is given by
$$\eta=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}}$$
This is generally considered $$\approx377\ohm$$
Or
$$\approx120\pi\ohm$$
