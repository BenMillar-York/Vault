The loss tangent of a material is defined as
$$tan \delta_{loss}=\frac{\sigma}{\omega\epsilon}$$
Where:
- $\sigma$ is the [[conductivity]] of the material
- $\omega$ is the [[Angular Frequency]]
- $\epsilon$ is the [[Dielectric Permittivity]] of the material

## Effect of classification of materials
The loss tangent of a material can be aproximately used to classify the material into a group depending roughly on the magnitude of the material's loss tangent.

It can be claimed that if the $tan \delta_{loss}$ is on the order of:
- 0 to $1*10^{-10}$
	- The material is a near- perfect dialectric
- $1*10^{-10}$ to $0.1$
	- The material is a low- loss dialectric
- $0.1$ to 100
	- The material is a high- loss dialectric
- $>1000$
	- The material is a good conductor
